         These aren't necessarily "builds" as they are store bought computers. These are the types of PC's you'd normally see in
         a classroom or office setting. They are pretty standard and powerful enough to last many years and get a lot of work done with.
         You can't really game with these computers (some you probably could) and are instead designed with work/school work in mind. You
         could build a similar computer with gaming in mind for the future by buying diverse parts, or you could go to your local best 
         buy and find something similar. They are also relatively inexpensive.

        Gaming builds are a lot more custom. These PC’s can be built with productivity in mind, or just gaming, or both. It’s really up 
        to the user. You can buy pre built gaming PC’s which can be more cost effective than building a fully custom computer, but it 
        really depends on a lot of things like parts and the state of the current market. It can be really fun to custom build your 
        computer and get all the flashy parts you want, or you can build it to look normal still perform well. Aesthetics usually aren’t 
        correlated to performance.
